==========
POND SCRUM
==========


OVERVIEW
--------

PondScrum is the basic SCRUM methodology as a Drupal Feature. We use contrib modules instead of custom code, keeping it easy for your to customize and extend.


CURRENT STATUS : PRE ALPHA
--------------------------

This project is still under early stage development and we are actively looking for people to help. If your interested please email alex@openlyconnected.com or come onto IRC (freenode.net) in #drupaluk or #drupal-pondscrum look for a_c_m (or any of the other contributors).


APPROACH
--------

Currently the general approach and workflow is detailed in a google doc, https://docs.google.com/View?id=dfwpwfhm_0gzc3xxc5 but we may also end up using http://wiki.github.com/a-c-m/pondscrum/ or perhaps even our own Atrium install to manage issues.

Most of the roadmap/feature set was agreed verbally at Drupalcon Copenhagen (on the sprint day), the basic rules of which were :

  1. Re-use existing modules before writing new code
  2. Try to make the code work with or without Open Atrium
  3. Try to make it simple for new people to learn and use SCRUM with this tool
  
As we see it there are 4 basic 'views', on top of node creation etc:
  
  1. Backlog priority - Re arranging the user stories by business need.
  2. Backlog structure - Keeping track of parent/child story relationships.
  3. Sprint view - Shows a sprint, its assigned stories and tasks as well as reporting stats/burn down charts.
  4. User Story display - Shows its details (the story, points, owner etc) and its tasks.
